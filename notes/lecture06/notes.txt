Memory Management – Swapping, Paging, and Virtual Memory
---------------------------------------------------------

Swap to disk 
- increase effective memory size 
- when a process is yielded/blocked, copy memory to disk and bring it back when it runs     
    - disk (hard or flash)
- relocation hardware -> put memory in dif RAM locations 
- help process believe that its memory as big as total RAM 

Paging 
- divide physical memory into units of a single fixed size, which is usually small, like 1-4k bytes or words
    - page frame
- treat virtual address space in the same way. 
    - page
- for each virtual address space page, store its data in one physical address page frame 
    - any
