INTRO TO OS
-----------

An operating system is a body of software that makes it easy to run programs, letting programs share memory, letting them interact with devices, etc.
Also called VIRTUAL MACHINE because transforms physical resource into general, power, and easy to use virtual form of itself.
Provides STANDARD LIBRARY to applications aka SYSTEM CALLS which are interfaces.
Also a RESOURCE MANAGER to CPU, memory, disk, other resources

VIRTUALIZING THE CPU = turning one CPU or few of them into seemingly infinite number of CPUs to allow multiple programs to seemingly run at once
VIRTUALIZING MEMORY = each process accesses its own private VIRTUAL ADDRESS SPACE that the OS maps to physical memory, so two programs can "write to address 0x2000 if it wants

THREAD = function running in same memory space as other functions, wiith more than one of them active at a time.
ATOMICALLY = executed all at once
    Increment counter = load value from memory to register, increment it, write back to memory --> not atomic

PERSISTENCE = if data is lost when power goes away or system crashes (VOLATILE) like DRAM
    Disk drives (I/O device and hard drives) and SSDs (SOLID STATE DRIVES) store data persistently 
    FILE SYSTEM = software in OS that manages disk, stores FILES created by user; not virtualized because should be shared across programs.

High PERFORMANCE and MINIMIZE OVERHEADS
PROTECTION between applications by ISOLATION of processes from one another
RELIABLE because when OS fails, all applicaitons running on it fail too. 
ENERGY EFFICIENT
SECURITY
MOBILITY because OS's are now run on smaller devices 

Usually program run in USER MODE = hardware resricts what application can do 
SYSTEM CALL --> special instruction called a TRAP where hardware transfers control to pre-specified TRAP HANDLER and raises privilege to KERNEL MODE where OS has full access to hardware of the system 
    OS finishes -> pass control back to user via RETURN FROM TRAP instruction which goes back to user mode and passes control back to where application left off 

MULTIPROGRAMMING = multiple jobs run on OS which would switch rapidly between them and utilize cpu better
