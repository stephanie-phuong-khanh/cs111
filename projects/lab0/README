INCLUDED FILES
- lab0.c: source code for module that does file redirection, causes segfault, handles signal, or copies input to output as specified by arguments passed to program
- Makefile: contains targets to compile lab0 program, create tarball, clean files produced by these commands, and run smoke test cases I wrote
- backtrace.png: screenshot of gdb run when lab0 is run with --segfault flag, and the stack backtrace for it
- breakpoint.png: screenshot of gdb run with `./lab0 --segfault` again but with break point set at line in program that caused segfault by bad assignment of null pointer
- README: this file

SMOKE TEST CASES
- file_redirection: runs lab0 with valid --input and --output flags, checks if contents of input file matche those of output file that was created and written to
- segfault: runs lab0 with --segfault flag, checks that return code is 139 as expected for SIGSEGV
- catch: runs lab0 with --segfault and --catch flags, checks that return code is 4
- invalid_argument: runs lab0 with flag --invalid_argument, checks that return code is 1
- invalid_input_file: runs lab0 with nonexistent file name as argument to --input flag, checks that return code is 2
